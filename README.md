# raytracer
My implementation of the Ray Tracer Challenge.

## Tuesday, February 18, 2020
I've started reading "The Ray Tracer Challenge" today.
The topic of ray tracing combines math and computer programming in one of my favorite ways.
This book claims to tackle it's subject using test-driven development,
which from my experience is incredibly difficult to do in any project that involves generating images,
so I'm eager to learn what he has to teach.

The book is designed for it's reader to translate pseudo-code and unit tests into any language and framework of choice.
I prefer .NET, and will probably pick on C# / .NET Core as that's the direction the Microsoft world is headed.
The unit tests are described using Cucumber syntax.
While I have tended to prefer xUnit for unit testing,
I will probably take this opportunity to learn the [SpecFlow library](https://specflow.org/).
